                <p>Welcome to my digital playground!</p>
<p>Since forever, I’ve been enchanted by computers—they’ve been my partners in crime for as long as I can remember. You’ll find here some of the coolest projects I’ve worked on, from bunking undergrad classes to spending entire weekends building things that made me go <em>&ldquo;Whoa, I made that!&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-do">What I Do</h3>
<p><img src="/me.jpg?width=200&amp;height=200" alt="Scenario 1: Across columns"></p>
<p>I thrive on designing, building, and optimizing <strong>smart, fault-tolerant systems</strong> that are as strong and reliable as they are innovative. DevOps? Oh, we’re besties. Whether it’s <strong>Bash</strong> or <strong>Python</strong>, I wield these tools like a wizard casting spells.</p>
<h3 id="beyond-the-screen">Beyond the Screen</h3>
<p>When I’m not neck-deep in code, you can usually find me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Experimenting in the kitchen (Pro tip: add saffron to your biryani for that magic touch).</li>
<li>Devouring books faster than my local library can keep up.</li>
<li>Working out at the park, convincing myself it&rsquo;s as fun as coding.</li>
</ul>
<p>As for food, I’m all about <strong>Biryani</strong> and <strong>plain Vanilla</strong>—though <em>not</em> the JavaScript kind. 😉</p>
<h3 id="lets-chat">Let’s Chat</h3>
<p>I’m always up for a good conversation—whether it’s about tech, philosophy, or that time you tried debugging for 3 hours only to discover a missing semicolon. Got coffee? Got beer? Let’s talk.</p>

<p>Thanks for stopping by. Stay curious, keep learning, and don’t forget to have some fun along the way! 🚀</p>
