Welcome to my digital playground!

Since forever, Iâ€™ve been enchanted by computersâ€”theyâ€™ve been my partners in crime for as long as I can remember. Youâ€™ll find here some of the coolest projects Iâ€™ve worked on, from bunking undergrad classes to spending entire weekends building things that made me go _"Whoa, I made that!"_.

### What I Do

I thrive on designing, building, and optimizing **smart, fault-tolerant systems** that are as strong and reliable as they are innovative. DevOps? Oh, weâ€™re besties. Whether itâ€™s **Bash** or **Python**, I wield these tools like a wizard casting spells.

### Beyond the Screen

When Iâ€™m not neck-deep in code, you can usually find me:

- Experimenting in the kitchen (Pro tip: add saffron to your biryani for that magic touch).
- Devouring books faster than my local library can keep up.
- Working out at the park, convincing myself it's as fun as coding.

As for food, Iâ€™m all about **Biryani** and **plain Vanilla**â€”though _not_ the JavaScript kind. ðŸ˜‰

### Letâ€™s Chat

Iâ€™m always up for a good conversationâ€”whether itâ€™s about tech, philosophy, or that time you tried debugging for 3 hours only to discover a missing semicolon. Got coffee? Got beer? Letâ€™s talk.

Thanks for stopping by. Stay curious, keep learning, and donâ€™t forget to have some fun along the way! ðŸš€
