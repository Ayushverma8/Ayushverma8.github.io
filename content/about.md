This space is dedicated to projects and people I’ve worked with.  I have been in love with computers since a (time going on forever). You will proabably come across all cool projects I’ve worked on by bunking undergrad class and killing weekends building intresting stuff. I like designing and building strong and healthy and fault-tolerant smart systems. I’ve a strong zeal for DevOps too. Bash and python are my bestfriends 👨‍🔧

When I’m not coding, tweeting or pushing pixels, you’ll find me cooking, reading books or working out in the park. In terms of food, I love Biryani and plain Vanilla (Not vanilla JavaScript though :)


 If you would like to talk with me or have a slightly weird but interesting talk/discussion over coffee/beer, feel free to drop at ayushverma8 AT outlook DOT com

Thanks for reading!
