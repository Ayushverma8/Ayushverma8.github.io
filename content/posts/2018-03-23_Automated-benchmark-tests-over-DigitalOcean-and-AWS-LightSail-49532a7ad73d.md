### VPS benchmarks

I did ran some standard benchmark tests over [DO](https://www.digitalocean.com/) and [AWS](https://lightsail.aws.amazon.com/ls/webapp/home) with bench.sh

SoÂ , hereâ€™s the Available stacks for deploying preconfigured stacks

AWS Lightsail is typically a EC2 Instance with Easier and less complicated GUIÂ . They offer standalone plans and stacks mentioned below -

Digital Ocean has very good community and set of Articles to get you Onboard the Server. They provide a few cool amazing stacks including Machine Leaning.

Now comes the pricingÂ , AWS Starts with 5$ Plan that provides 512MB RAM and 512GM Transfer but at the same PriceÂ , Digital Ocean provides 1 GB of RAM and 1TB Transfer. Decision is yours ðŸ’¸

Digital OceanÂ :

Hereâ€™s results of benchmarks ran over 1 GB Ubuntu server at London Data Centre.

**Keep an eyeÂ , The I/O Operations speed is 241MB/S and Average goes to 445MB/S.**

AWS LightSail

LightSail got an I/O Speed of 67.8MB/S which is definitely slower and would cause issues in Memory Intensive Applications.

### Inference

SoÂ , At 10$Â , If you are looking for heavy memory intensive applications and good alert system then Digital Ocean is definitely a better choice in market

But If you are complete newbie and looking for just easy workaround like downloadÂ .pem and get started then LightSail is a good option for youÂ .

HopeÂ , That helpedÂ . ðŸ’š
