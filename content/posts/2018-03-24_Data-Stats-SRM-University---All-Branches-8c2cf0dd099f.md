I wrote some crawlers for Facebook , LinkedIn , Resume Websites and crawled some relatable data for **Batch 2014–2018 and Batch 2015–2019** . Here’s some of the Analysis Insights. This are just for experimental purpose.

1.  **A1 +ve** blood group people are actually born as topper and are too frequent in Topper list. Majority of them were from **CBSE Board**.

2\. People born in and around **August 1996 to January 1997** were the one with high GPA’s. _I am a bloody Exception._ 😐

3\. We have almost **One Girl out of Four**. Sounds cool eh ? Nah We will Die Single 😫

4\. Now , Blood Group v/s Students. Umm , I see , **We have 35% O+ve peps**. Cheers , I’m of those O+ve 😻

_Tighten your seatbelts , This is arguably best Insight !_

5\. Girls were high on GPA list every damn time. No idea how but yeah , it’s happening 😝 . We fellow boys were more near 8.0ish and 8.7ish.
